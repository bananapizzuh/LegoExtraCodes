# LegoExtraCodes  
This is a W.I.P program to automate the process of putting in the extra unlock codes inside of lego games. I was too lazy to take 15 minutes to put them in, so I decided to make this program. If you have any issues, please report them! I plan to add support for more games in the future. 

## Installation 
Download the executable from the releases page. Once you click the start button in the application, you have whatever your delay time is to switch back to the game.
